yea, I had a portfolio website before built with Astro but it was trash so, I decided to build a new and even better one. (aesthetically speaking)
<br/><br/>
I did build the entire site from scratch, with of course the help of components library. I listed those below, check it out if you're interested. other than that, everything was my own work.
took me like 3 days going back and forth changing the design to complete the entire thing. that's why you design first then code kids.
<br/><br/>
I'll probably update the repo again soon, let's see if I can find any interesting animated components. next thing in the pipeline is to connect a headless CMS, if I got some time to spare lmao. 

## stacks
simple, nothing fancy
<br/>
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Acertinity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com)
- [Themes for shadcn/ui](https://ui.jln.dev)

## installation

if you're interested with the design (I bet you do), feel free to follow the steps below. but please, at least change the theme, don't plagiat my design dude.
<br/><br/>

run these commands
```sh
git clone https://github.com/escornbar/portfolio-website-v2.git
```
```sh
npm i
```
and, start coding lol
```sh
code.
```

## credits
I took inspiration from how clean [ray's](https://github.com/mdrhmn) portfolio site is, pardon the similarities and don't attac me pls
<br/>
[wanjo](https://github.com/KeluhingBavui) because he introduced me to Acertinity UI library which was REALLY helpful making the animations
